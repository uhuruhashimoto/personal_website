## About Me
This is a personal website I made for fun in JS and CSS. It's currently deployed at https://uhuruhashimoto.com/. It's aims to be semi responsive across most platforms -- the self-proclaimed goal of a backend dev taking his first shot at design. :)

This website is made up of five sections - a Bio, Projects, Experience, and Achievements sections. Each section begins with an image and is followed by a brief description. The site also contains a navigation bar and contact links (components).

## Tools
This app uses React. The bare framework was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and I added the components manually. I used Figma to prototype.

## Run Locally
`npm start` will demo the app on localhost

## Build
`npm run build` will build for deployment
